# Script to scrape UKMT questions

A number of websites, including UKMT's, hold images of the UKMT's questions.

As a "small" project, I thought I'd try to scrape them and output them, so they are more readily accesible and more easily edited than in their current form.

## Requirements
* poppler - `brew install poppler`
